Dart Types
spin dart - speeds up dartboard spin
armour dart - locks a section of board, ie all no new darts can hit that section
knocker dart - knocks off all darts in section, unless armoured
double point dart - double the points for section
magnet dart - tracks toward nearest dart
roulette dart - spins around the board and slows until it lands on section then knocks that section
slider dart - makes board slide back and forth or up and down
repel dart - repels from nearest dart (opposite of magnet)
goofy dart - makes a fun noise
**investment dart - some points each round (n/5ths?)

Darts to cut maybe
>slider
>spin
>investment

Other ideas
done (in git history)>swapper dart - swaps wherever it lands with another random section
>blinder dart - makes points invisible for next player turn
>scatter dart - splits dart in flight
>vacuum dart - sucks a nearby enemy dart to the section it lands on
